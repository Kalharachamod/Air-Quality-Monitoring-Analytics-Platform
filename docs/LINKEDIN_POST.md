# LinkedIn Post - Air Quality Monitoring Data Warehouse Project

---

🚀 **Excited to share my latest data engineering project: Near Real-Time Air Quality Monitoring & Analytics Platform!**

I've built an end-to-end data warehouse solution that monitors air quality across 13+ major cities worldwide, providing actionable insights for environmental health.

**🔧 Tech Stack:**
• **ETL Pipeline**: Python (requests, psycopg2) - Extracts data from Open-Meteo Air Quality API
• **Data Warehouse**: PostgreSQL with Star Schema design (Fact + Dimension tables)
• **OLAP Layer**: Materialized views for fast analytical queries
• **BI Visualization**: Power BI dashboards
• **Web Application**: Flask-based analytics portal with interactive charts

**📊 Key Features:**
✅ Near real-time data ingestion (5-15 minute updates)
✅ Star schema data warehouse (Location, Time, Pollutant dimensions)
✅ OLAP materialized views for optimized analytics
✅ Beautiful, responsive web dashboard with:
   - Daily AQI trends with health risk indicators
   - Monthly pollutant analysis (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, O₃, CO)
   - City-wise comparisons
   - Interactive charts and visualizations

**🌍 Cities Monitored:**
Colombo, Delhi, Mumbai, Dhaka, Beijing, Shanghai, Tokyo, London, Paris, Berlin, New York, Los Angeles, Dubai

**💡 What I Learned:**
• Designing efficient star schema data warehouses
• Implementing OLAP concepts using PostgreSQL materialized views
• Building ETL pipelines for near real-time data processing
• Creating user-friendly analytics dashboards
• Best practices in data engineering and business intelligence

**🎯 Project Impact:**
This system enables stakeholders to:
- Monitor air quality trends in real-time
- Make data-driven decisions for public health
- Compare pollution levels across cities
- Understand health risks through AQI categorization

The architecture follows industry best practices: **API → ETL → Data Warehouse → OLAP Views → BI Tools & Web App**

**Alternative Shorter Version:**

🚀 **Just completed an end-to-end Air Quality Monitoring Data Warehouse project!**

Built a near real-time system that:
• Ingests air quality data from 13+ cities via Python ETL
• Stores in PostgreSQL star schema data warehouse
• Powers analytics through OLAP materialized views
• Visualizes insights via Power BI & Flask web dashboard

**Tech:** Python, PostgreSQL, Star Schema, OLAP, Power BI, Flask

**Key Learnings:** Data warehouse design, ETL pipelines, OLAP concepts, BI visualization

Perfect example of how data engineering enables environmental monitoring and public health insights! 🌍
